I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey,
and if at some point one stops the process, that person is out of the
game. My constant learning in both horizontal and vertical dimensions
has landed me some of the best opportunities I could have ever dreamt
of, in the last few years.  

Spending almost 2 years now in web development, I have landed myself
into various opportunistic projects and platform to work with people 
with diverse intellect. For me work has always been my priority. 

Social media is a tool you can use to leverage your digital identity,
an identity on which only you have the control. I am a product of
digital identity and strongly believe in creating an online presence.
